		<h2>Dear Bash,</h2>
		<p>I'm sorry to say I see you as nothing but a friend.</p>
		<p>You are a perfect friend because you are always there when I need you. I don't need to download anything, look for anything. No matter what, you are there.</p>
		<p>And you are know me so well. If I need to find anything, I can just ask you. I can use <div class = "vocab">pwd</div> to find out where I am and <div class="vocab">cd</div> to go anywhere I need to go. You are also my connection to git, the love of my life.</p>
		<p>We work so well togetherâ€”you help me make directories with <div class="vocab">mkdir</div> and folders with <div class="vocab">touch</div>. And you do a good job of frightening away gross ads that I don't want, especially with the code line <div class = "vocab">curl -s "URL GOES HERE" grep Target</div>.</p>
		<p>Bash, you are wonderful and we should be best friends forever. But never anything more. </p>
