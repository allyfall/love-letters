		<h2>Dear Bash,</h2>
		<div class="bg">
			<p>I'm sorry to say I see you as nothing but a friend.</p>
			<p>You are a perfect friend because you are always there when I need you. I don't need to download anything, look for anything. No matter what, you are there.</p>
			<p>And you are know me so well. If I need to find anything, I can just ask you. I can use <span class="vocab">pwd</span> to find out where I am and <span class="vocab">cd</span> to go anywhere I need to go. You are also my connection to git, the love of my life.</p>
			<p>We work so well togetherâ€”you help me make directories with <span class="vocab">mkdir</span> and folders with <span class="vocab">touch</span>. And you do a good job of frightening away gross ads that I don't want, especially with the code line <span class="vocab">curl -s "URL GOES HERE" grep Target</span>.</p>
			<p>Bash, you are wonderful and we should be best friends forever. But never anything more. </p>
