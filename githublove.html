		<h2>Dear Github,</h2>
		<p>Why, oh why, do you insist on following me everywhere I go? I swear, every time I start a new project, there you are, floating along on a little cloud behind me. The way you hold onto my work for ever is strange, but endearing. And you display it for the public to see...which, again, is a little odd. </p>
		<p>You allow me to work with people, which is nice, sometimes. But really, you are so open, you have no standards at all. With you, almost everything is public.</p>
		<p>Despite your faults, I suppose that I do appriciate how hard you try. Like the way that I can just type ``` and then some code and you try to guess what language I am coding inanguage I am writing in. That is pretty cool. You also allow me to declare the language too, and then make it pretty colors so I know what I am doing wrong.</p>
		<p>Oh Github, if you were not so ubiqitous we would never get along. But alas, I am forced to know you because literally everyone else does.</p>
