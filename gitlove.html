		<h2>Dear Git,</h2>
		<p>You have opened my eyes to a whole new world of vaguely frightening complexity. Now, not only can I mess up my own work, but I can mess up other peoples work too! What wild adventures we will have.</p>
		<p>We work so wonderfully together...kinda. As long as I can remember what order I am supposed to do things. Which I can't, usually. I am always afraid to <div class = "vocab">commit</div>, and then I <div class = "vocab">push</div> you away. What I should do is make my file, save it locally, then <div class="vocab">add</div> it. Then I am free to <div class="vocab">commit</div> in my own time. Or, I can slow down and check our <div class="vocab">status</div>.</p>
		<p>My favorite thing about you is that you are so flexible--you really understand all of my strange lingo. It is like we have a code, like we made a bunch of <div class="vocab">alias</div> for common commands, so no one else in the whole wide world can read my code. Because reproducibility doesn't matter to anyone. That is soooo nifty. As cheesy as it is, I think you really git me.</p>
		<p>All of my very unreliable love.</p>
