		<h2>Dear Git,</h2>
		<p>You have opened my eyes to a whole new world of vaguely frightening complexity. Now, not only can I mess up my own work, but I can mess up other peoples work too! What wild adventures we will have.</p>
		<p>We work so wonderfully together...kinda. As long as I can remember what order I am supposed to do things. Which I can't, usually. I am always afraid to <span class = "vocab">commit</span>, and then I <span class = "vocab">push</span> you away. What I should do is make my file, save it locally, then <span class="vocab">add</span> it. Then I am free to <span class="vocab">commit</span> in my own time. Or, I can slow down and check our <span class="vocab">status</span>.</p>
		<p>My favorite thing about you is that you are so flexible--you really understand all of my strange lingo. It is like we have a code, like we made a bunch of <span class="vocab">alias</span> for common commands, so no one else in the whole wide world can read my code. Because reproducibility doesn't matter to anyone. That is soooo nifty. As cheesy as it is, I think you really git me.</p>
		<p>All of my very unreliable love.</p>
